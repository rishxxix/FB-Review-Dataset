When someone says they hope covid positive die and I respond by calling this person a dumb b...h I get blocked for 30 days and they don't, telling me it goes against their standards. Mark Zuckerburg made it obvious he is all for the crooked left democrats and if FB don't like your comment they block you and not the other person. This has happened several times. Mark Zuckerburg is a big nobody in my book and follows in the crooked left democrat footsteps. He is nothing but a wealthy puppet with no self respect. Facebook use to be a good social media platform but now it is a complete joke. They want to control you just like the far left criminals in Washington. Im sure this review and the many other bad reviews mean nothing to him because he knows it won't have a impact on his business. Facebook and Mark Zuckerburk is nothing but a socialist joke.

The propaganda of communism that is banned in some countries is missed but you are blocked if you respond contrary to that view.

I talked to someone over the phone for a shop consultation and they sounded like they would help me reverse what happened and charge my ad credit instead of my credit card. They even told me to CC them in emails, but nope, I just got email after email from different people saying the case is closed and that I did the wrong thing by not ""claiming"" the credit, which it did not say anywhere when I was building the ad. The whole thing was like a scam and the worst customer service I've ever received. It's like they tell you to your face that you can get your refund on the credit card when they talk to you in person, and talk about following up and everything but actually, they didn't do anything and didn't do a refund. When I CC'd the person who did the consultation, she also did not reply. I could refund a portion through my credit card company which is a hassle -- sending paperwork etc. Just FYI.

Both pages are promoting my two YouTube channels and unfortunately my YT channels' traffic hasn't improved a great deal, maybe just a few views out of all the FB likes. No gain at all. Another problem is the FB reach, my posts have not been shown to all the people who liked my pages. And after stopping the ads, the organic reach dropped even more. A post from last week reached only 40% of my followers. Another post from yesterday reached only 15% of them. And guess what, when I publish the same post from my personal account, there's no reach either, almost nothing comparing to the time before buying their ads. Apparently I paid for making my situation worse than before. I regret I spent money on FB ads, it's just not worth it at all. A total waste of money. The only thing I get in massive proportions is FB intrusive ads trying to make me buy their ads again... And I'm not a business, I don't have funds for advertisement. If you think of buying ads from them, think again.",2

I come and go. I actually really enjoy it but too much! That's the problem.It starts to become an overwhelming place to be after a while mostly because of all the messages I get, if you have ADHD you often ignore messages or mean to look at them later and then forget. This is what happens and then I feel guilty because I am seemingly ignoring people and I end up feeling bad about myself and I leave. This is the important point I would like to make... Facebook gives the option to not have people comment on your posts. I would like Facebook to give the option of not being available for contact via messages. (I don't use the messenger app, I go to desktop view to see my messages) I don't want anyone to send me personal messages on Facebook because actually 90% of them are nonsense. If messages could go it would be a relief and I might stay longer.Also in light of hearing that someone commited suicide on a live stream video on Facebook I think Facebook should not allow live video anymore, it's too open to abuse.",1
16,M√°t√© Kiss,2020-07-16,2,Always unusable,"And I don't mean the usual stuff you normally give to a website, like a username you choose and an email and a password.I recently made an account with them in order to use it to promote a Youtube channel I run through a different email than this one. Thought it would be a good way to get in contact with fans of the channel and interact with them. No more than twelve hours after I made it, Facebook locked my account, claiming I'm impersonating someone 'famous', and is demanding I go through their frankly suspicious security procedures to unlock my account again.An 'I am not a robot' captcha? Fine. That's simple enough, pretty common too. A code they send to your phone? A little strange but okay, I guess. A clear photo of myself without obstructions and good lighting? Sounds like facial recognition to me, which I didn't sign up for. A photo of a current identification card? No. Absolutely not. That's incredibly suspicious and I will not be slotted into some database for them to find me if I put one toe out of line. I'm pretty sure that's illegal too, but I don't know enough about the laws surrounding that to contest it just yet.I decided to partially fudge my photo of myself, but stopped and never sent in a photo of my ID, because that's dangerous. They claim it's to 'check to make sure you're using a real name', which is BS, because all forms of ID they ask for have home addresses and other sensitive information on them. They claim to delete them after you send them in, but you can almost guarantee they don't. What were they going to ask for next? My social security number? My bank accounts? A credit card? How deep does THAT rabbit hole go, I wonder.Whatever happened to anonymity and the ability to connect? Why are you holding my accounts hostage under pretense of making sure 'I'm a real person'? Combined with other complaints of being a platform where being a decent human being apparently gets you banned, I'm never trusting them with anything truly personal, and I would highly suggest you find a different platform to keep in touch with friends and family.If I could give 0 stars for this abhorrent behaviour, I would.

It will happen like a flash unexpected and time shall be no more for repentance. In my dream, it was as if God shut his ears. I saw multitude of people running into a church. But inside that church, screaming and shouting everywhere; people making utterances to heaven. Behold it was as if a strange spirit entered into some people more clearly, I remember seeing an old man who was beside me whom the said spirit entered into and as he let out a cry, he disappeared and few other people. At that point, I realised that the rapture has taken place. I cried the more. Immediately, the devil took over and started making mockery of the left over Christians. He had a register of everyone's name...At this point, I woke up. The end is more than near. What breaks my heart the most is that many people in the church will not make it if Jesus comes now?Many are unaware that the end is near. Don't tell me that it's advancement in technology or development. If any area of your life is not in sync with God's word - Repent and be converted. If you miss heaven you can never miss hell...think about it.

I responded to this in the comments section because one of two of my accounts had been frozen for some stupid security reason and they would not unfreeze it.  I entered a complaint.  They sent me an email saying that all I had to do was try and sign back in and there were steps to fix it.  I tried to sign back in and it was the same process of providing personal information.  I responded to that email and posted a picture of their demands in my comments section and now, without any security issue, they have blocked me from my other account.

I am then asked to send my ID and a photo of myself with a code they generate.  Once I‚Äôve done that, I receive an automated reply email which sends me a temporary password to get in... but what they‚Äôve failed to do is turn off the two factor authentication, which leaves me in the exact same position. I don‚Äôt need a new password I know my password to get that far!  I then reply to let them know of the issue they‚Äôve failed to assist with, but they never reply.they rely on an automated system which has not been thought out.

It's a connection on social media between myself, work collegues or friends or family.    I am now noticing flaws in the website. Privacy and safety for instance. There is nothing to stop somebody writing harassing or abusive text on your timeline if they are on your friends list. There is no way to report this instance and the help and support is not adequate because it is all in text and you cannot speak to anybody in customer service, you can post a question to the community but there is no direct line for something that seems to be everywhere. If you then go onto the persons profile to try and report them. There is a minimal list of multiple choice reasons which you cannot add information to as evidence or at all.   I do continue to use the website and app that it offers but I see no moderation for inappropriate abusive and potentially harmful content. I give it 1 star because of how long it has been almost a part of lifestyle now, how much money it has made and I cant seem to understand why it would show such minimal care for its users. It even has a film made after it and still seems to be stuck in the past and unnmoderated. Even my Xbox system has a report button for abusive messages. It doesn't make me want to use anymore Facebook if I'm honest.",1

8,Teddy Ng,2020-05-28,4,I mean what can I do without Facebook,"Facebook is by far the worst site I've used in years. It has constant issues loading, keeping track of things I've posted and in solving issues I've had. In the last year I had my account on there hacked, I contacted them instantly in hopes of getting in back and waited for them to reply after giving them EVERYTHING they asked for. But no reply, I kept checking and over 6 months later and still no fuckingg reply. I have now checked and the person who STOLE my account has now deleted my email from it and fully taken all ability of me ever getting my thousands of pictures to do with my daughter, my photography etc back. I have now forever lost them just as I had been starting to back them up. So thank you facebook for proving you are the biggest mess up of a website with the most uncaring staff who can't even read an issue and respond. Myspace is a million times better than facebook. Best idea to anyone reading this, don't make an account on facebook with anything that isn't backed up in triplicate. Don't discuss anything personal on it like I did about my recent tragedy and remember to have back up accounts with everything and everyone that's important to you on it as they won't give a shitt if you lose everything. I even think I know who took over my account and begged facebook for help sending multiple messages and still nothing, they couldn't even reply with a ""we're looking into your issue"" and I even emailed their heads. Don't bother with them and don't make the same mistakes I made. My depression is now worse knowing I have lost priceless irreplaceable pictures, contacts and notes including my poetry and things to do with my book and my business pages all thanks to facebook not protecting it's users.

A completely morally corrupt and slimy bunch of creeps!   I have had accounts disabled because I would not send them copies of my ID. I had to contact several legal firms to regain access to my accounts.  And since then I have not gotten a notification for a message.  Post notifications are erratic, repetitive and delayed. I used to use their ""live"" frequently.  Now If I try, I get ""unable to connect""  or my video is reduced to a smeary blur of pixels that are unwatchable.  ""Live"" is delayed from 40 seconds to 2 minutes. That is not ""live"". That is intercepted and rebroadcast after their bots scan the stream for useful info to sell to any shady third party with the money, regardless of origin.  Ever since they were forced to let me back into my account,  it has been a glitchtastic nightmare. You, as a facebook user are livestock.  You are there to be sold, traded, experimented upon (see ""Emotional Contagion"") Pages are forced to PAY for likes, to PAY to let their pages be seen.  Even then the pages are only promoted to irrelevant areas. So when you pay them for something that should be totally organic and un-restricted,  you still get ripped off.  EVERY keystroke or click is tracked!  Even when you are not logged in. Message can be intercepted and seen by ""moderators"" in third-world countries.  ""Mods"" who are not trained, vetted or monitored.  ""Mods"" who can download and keep any content they wish. Mods in places known for creepy men asking for pics of ""bbobs and vegene"" can sell images of your kids to any pedo. Can sell images of your wife and kids to human traffickers.  If you have their horrible, battery and data hogging apps on your phone,  you do NOT own that phone.   It, and every photo, message call log etc in it, are owned by facebook. They track your GPS,  Microphone and camera at all times.  (Think about that  while you are texting from the bathroom) ONE site  requires FOUR apps?  FB, Messenger, Page manager and Group manager.  WHY?  Each app requiring a huge amount of resources from your device, for tracking and spying 24-7. I had FB and messenger apps on my phone.  My phone was always hot. Sometimes so hot It was uncomfortable to hold. The battery was dead in 4 hours.  My data used up in a week.   I uninstalled the apps.  Battery: lasted all day and more.  Data:  had some left over each month.  Phone: cool as a cucumber.  Facebook does NOT care about you, the cattle!  You only exist to them as livestock! Get out!  Get your family and friends out!  Remove the apps from your phones!  Delete all accounts!It's a virus.  A very dangerous virus!",1

I have been a victim at the hands of the Washington state employer Western state hospital ""sexual harassment"". I sued the hospital and won and I am correcting fighting the unjustly justice system that Facebook as blocked live evidence showing my innocence this is blue collar code like behavior.  Extremely passive aggressive do as I not as I do punish one and allow others to make hateful false posts pertaining to my culture, my nationality my history of people.  It is unfair that Facebook says that Easter is tied to Jesus when in fact it is Ishtar. This is a hate crime, this is discrimination. It is also damaging and traumatic that natural born men and women have to digest the transgender persons as they mimic us and if WE as natural born people stand up for or naturally born identity vs the ones wanting to be identified as we are punished and these people that had a choice are more protected vs us that were born the sex we are. Facebook violates the constitutional rights of the people, this app is on my phone and is my possession and I give them no permission what so ever to access my account in any form or fashion as my right as a so called American citizen but is this even proper treatment towards an American citizen to have no rights to do anything but what the caucasian people suggest a black American to do. If a black American gets to vocal or educational punishment is the next option and only option to male a black American think. Punishing the people for freedom of speech is the way of the land, ask brother Louis Frahakkan. The company fails to exercise its policies against homosexual people, transgender, certain religious groups. Facebook does not allow for people to educate their people of color, trying to unify and empower their people of color. The company allows for people to promote their religion, their beliefs, sexual anything that goes against what any HOLY SCRIPTURES say. This company violates rights with face recognition, voice recognition,  forces you to give them permission to your picture gallery to upload pictures for your distant family. When all they wanna do is snoop through your phone without a search warrant. Violate 1st amendment, 14th amendment, 4th amendment. They deleted factual information, put me in Facebook jail for posting public information. Facebook promotes underage children to post sexual pictures videos dancing provocatively and knowing that prisoners had pedophiles arw on Facebook and the had the ability to deactivate the account but refuse to do that or report criminal sex trafficking or extortion.

Every step you do on fb, it is monitored from what you like to what you hate.I remember when you could have used fb without too many adverts back in 2016. Since then their adverts became longer and longer going from 5 sec to 15 sec. Nowadays, if you pause the video, the thumbnail appears making you unable to stop to see the image you actually stopped the video for. These are all evidence of how fb became careless about your experience and only thinking their benefits. They know that people are still going to use Facebook as we have no choices. The solution is stopping using fb everyone together which may attract their attention.In addition, there is too much fake news and misinformation about politics, social issue or hate towards a specific religion ethnicity or nation. Who cares? we still going to use fb and they won't take any action.  There is option below saying ""Let Facebook know about your review. Just check the box and we'll notify them.

0,Ramsey Wilton,2020-03-28,1,Can't access FB account because somehow‚Ä¶,"I can't access an FB account because somehow someone got into it and changed the password & primary email.  It's no big loss because the account was for my dog.  I have a fluffy 100lb dog, friends/family love her and additionally we go back and forth w food/toy/vet/joint/play-date etc. narrative.  I'm posting this review because Facebook was really odd with regards to how they handled the recovery.Here's what happened:  Mar 16th - Out of no where I received a confirmation text of a change in my account.  I tried logging in and my password didn't work and saw the recovery email had been changed to an unknown email account.  Hence, I went through the recovery steps which were unsuccessful and FB subsequently requested I forward 2 forms of  identification.  Mar 18th - I received a response saying that I didn't attach valid form of ID...so I resent the info but this time with a photo of my drivers license (I was hesitant to send my drivers info but relented), never head anything back.... Mar 24th - Pinged Facebook for any follow up, no response so I tried logging in and this time the recovery steps worked but I was directed to my old FB personal account that I haven't used in over a decade and it's been like this since.So: The credentials for an FB account I created for my pup now work but they direct me to my defunct personal FB account.  Additionally, I can still access the defunct personal FB account using it's original email address but I have to use the password I created for my pup's account.  As for the pup's FB account, it's still out there and you can see it but you can't login to it. Something just popped into my head, who would want to hack a dog's FB profile?Years ago I started 2nd guessing FB's usefulness due to stalkers/oddballs but decided it was best to stay away for privacy reasons.  Over time I softened up and created an account for my pup as it seemed a harmless task, a fun way to keep in touch and (aside from the hilarity) it turned out to be a really good way to share useful info.  Now, I'm not so sure....1 - You see, how on earth was someone able to change my primary email & pass without any confirmation?  I'd heard stories about things like that but assumed it was all down to stupidity.  Well I'm eating my words, this 'really' can happen.  Anyway, I received an account 'change alert' and it wasn't addressed to me and when I tried logging in, I couldn't.  Also, in the 'account recovery' process I could see the primary email had already been changed.  2 - I've had two FB accounts in my life, my pup's account and my personal account and both were independent of each other, different email, tel#'s and different recovery emails by design.  Work required separate mobile & messaging solutions and it didn't take long before I saw the benefits of this and decided this was a good practice to implement in personal areas.  FB used my drivers license to correctly identify 'me' in both accounts, then took the initiative to divert my pup's account login to my defunct personal account.  It looks like FB decided my pup's account wasn't necessary and would rather I start using my defunct personal account again.  Ironically, FB left the pup's profile intact, you can still see it, post to it and friend request it (although, you won't get any response).  I work in the financial industry and work recommends avoiding all social media unless necessary.  I think they're right.  If you find yourself needing social media, then identify the tasks (such as professional interests, notifications, general interests and so on) and create aliases, email accounts as needed to build a buffer that can provide a level of protection for yourself, loved ones, colleagues etc..",1

I am getting over this, I go through the right channels and report the videos when they pop up but Facebook do nothing about it and leave it up because of all the attention its getting (I suppose). Is there something I missed where Facebook is allowed to show this content and is no longer Family friendly? I am over it, no one respects peoples privacy anymore.

I am sure that I am NOT online, but Facebook sometimes thinks so. This is an old bug. Come on Facebook, finally solve this!Then almost every week they invent something new. A GOOD firm would TEST those new pats of the program. Not Facebook. Or they test it in a very bad way. Also why all users have to use those new things. Give all users the opportunity to switch on or off big parts of Facebook. I use my screen vertically, let's say, in portrait mode.

THEY have to decide how things will be, so that it is not like now: the different teams try to copy each other, but they never succeed completely. Example: if you think you know all when you are experienced user of Facebook on computer, you feel a beginner when you ever try to use it on a smartphone.I can go on and write a book about it.

Myers,2019-12-29,7,Average in Certain Areas,"Average.Firstly, it is a very handy social networking site if you want to stay connected to work colleagues, former school friends and distant family. This is my reasons behind using Facebook.Although, from personal experiences of being harassed, victimised and cyberbullied on this network by others I have come to a conclusion it would be so much easier to have people all over the world to be able to help support others on the social network like a form of a chat utility that is monitored solely by humans. I understand that there may be around 2.45 billion active users from around the world and 1:1 support would be somewhat impossible. On the other hand, Facebook do have utilities on the site to allow blocking, unfriending, unfollowing and reporting of media shared, which is good. But I believe if something has been reported, Facebook should automatically close down the status/ video or whatever temporarily until Facebook has looked into it to avoid the user from deleting things off the post etc. so that they can see the full picture and take the best action.Generally a good site but I have had to keep making new accounts everytime I kept reporting the users instigating hatred as they were not against the Community Standards - I believe that this is because the users that were against me kept deleting their comments. It would be a good update for FB to temporarily close down reported posts etc so they can see as soon as it's been reported what people have said and done to get a realistic idea and choose the course of action on what to do next.4 Stars due to the often misconceptions surrounding reported posts.",4

The only reason I use it at the moment is that I have a lot of friends on there, but as they move to twitter etc, then so will I follow, as I already have an account on several other platforms. Non existant customer service, and dying slowly but surely. Goodbye facebook.",1

I was contacted and bullied by people who wanted naked selfies (facebook allowed this to happen) of me (which I would never even think of doing), and they asked me for money or They would make my life hell. so I told facebook and they gave ME (the victim) a warning not to send naked selfies on facebook or my account would be deleted. so I deleted it myself years ago to stop the harassment and bullying. so recently I thought I would try it again (big mistake) could'nt even open up another account because they kept disabling it, I am Completely done with these lowlife facebook dum dums. facebook is the absolute worst social media in the world and should be shut down permanently.",1

Since then my son got one email from facebook about being reported and was limited to posting. The client ended up at this point blocking my son after few days my son got another email from facebook about being reported again this is twice. Now when he tried to log into facebook it will ask for his mobile number. When he enters it into the box and click on send, he will get the code when he enters the code into the box and click on next, a message will show up ""Your going to fast"". The next day after 24 hours he tried again this time i told him to enter my phone number so i got the code and he entered it into the box and again got the same message ""Your going to fast"". Myself and another family member posted on the facebook community page asking for help rather then helping both our post gets deleted, so my family member tried again and now her account is limited on post.

15,Emily hazlewood ,2019-10-29,1,Facebook silences victims of sexual harassment,"Firstly Facebook is a business. Facebook operates in numerous country‚Äôs, it has no respect for the laws in them. In fact it has proven time and time again that it is willing to pay fines rather than solve problems.Facebook is above the law in every country, and is now having meetings with our politicians. Facebook was involved in brexit for its own personal agenda, they are now having meeting with one of the most deluded political party‚Äôs to ever exist in the U.K. #tories To understand what Facebook is truly about you first need to be involved with Facebook advertising.Facebook for a start is NOT a platform for all ideas, nor is it truthful like savvy traveller states, in fact the complete and utter opposite.We do not owe Facebook any thanks or apology‚Äôs only an individual taking advantage of facebooks advertising systems and making money would state such a thing.Repeatedly, it‚Äôs the rich folks that keep splitting this nonsense. The ones who are financially stable are the ones that need Facebook to prop up their businesses.Facebook is a platform to make money at the cost of your personal information. ‚Ä¢ Facebook as a business (Not a social network) does not provide the necessary means of complaints. (Rarely does they reply, if at all. It is the most outdated non existent complaints system the world has ever seen) this is detrimental to the running of a business and illegal not to have in some countries. But they just keep paying the politicians.‚Ä¢ Facebook are categorically a bunch of liars.How savvy traveller could say they are not is beyond belief? Does savvy work for Facebook? Trey gowdy in fact has clearly proved every lie Facebook has told we don‚Äôt have to listen to their manipulation. ‚Ä¢Facebook is allowed to close your account for any reason without any substance justified or not. They will do with without contact to the authorised owners of the social networking account. ‚Ä¢Facebook clearly breaches privacy rules and has done for a long time. Will it matter? ... No ... Why? ... because information is valuable.Facebook offer the services of advertising. You pay for an add, they put it in front of the audience you decide from the amount of users in its database, and based on either their actions devices location etc narrow it down and target your audience. You are not guaranteed a sale - essentially it is gambling.These adverts alone are enough to get you removed from Facebook - so having an ad with text in excess of 20% will have you removed from Facebook.The excuses Facebook use to remove users from their platform amounts to discrimination.Why should a company be allowed to discriminate and cause public anxiety and frustration?Why should this entity be able to run around the world doing as they please? Insulting whom they want? Restricting individuals right to speak and expose the wrongdoings these countries around the world play host to.We understand the situation of how Facebook started, and it was pure corruption at the greedy hands of Zuckerberg.Zuckerberg stood in front of his own constituents and lied and lied and lied, as red as the day came. It only has to be watched to be understood.It‚Äôs on tv there‚Äôs plenty of case study‚Äôs for the narrow minded people that can‚Äôt be bothered to search, but want to sit their and let their one sided brains lie to them. Facebook is extremely manipulating and it‚Äôs characteristics cause widespread frustration. I have used Facebook since the year after it was released and I can honestly say this is not a platform for anyone other than the ones that have a business.Anyone that doesn‚Äôt have a business you are a test case, you have products marketed to you through the actions you have taken whilst been a member on Facebook.Watch the tech lead on Facebook (a Facebook tech lead recently fired)  for having a YouTube channel. It beggars belief that Facebook and google are the United States biggest spying network and that‚Äôs the sole reason they still operate with impunity. Didn‚Äôt trump start threatening people that was going to make Facebook and google taxable? YES.I had a Facebook account - I also had another - I keep this account to keep my political opinions away from my family and friends they don‚Äôt want to see it nor do they need to, and also to keep advertising two stores that I have on Shopify.I reserve that right and it has nothing to do with Facebook if I own two accounts what‚Äôs the harm? ... nothing. Here‚Äôs the reason why it‚Äôs no problem ... everything I have stated on my secondary account be it political or not, has been true. Is it a spam account ... Hell NO. Why Facebook dorsent have the right to shut secondary account - Facebook has been running for years, they have extremely well paid developers that can developer anything, literally.Now it‚Äôs pretty simple, if you open you‚Äôre Facebook app and login:sign up, with multiple accounts your account will be flagged as suspicious.If you open multiple accounts via your browser your account is fine, developer some software that reads from phones if they already have an account if they do don‚Äôt let them sign up, if they don‚Äôt let them sign up.Facebook will let you sign up run for a few weeks and then close you down and not refund you even if you have paid for adds.A very quick and fraudulent way of making money. Anyone who exposes this is called a liar. Facebook doesn‚Äôt allow two accounts but does NOT state anywhere that is clear enough, or easy enough to direct to. Facebook then closes your accounts or bans access to them, that‚Äôs all fine and dandy but... they send nothing along with it no email no ways of knowing what‚Äôs going on.Contacting Facebook is virtually unheard of, what makes this more concerning is that it is only too business they offer a way of contact but even that is a huge complaint. It‚Äôs ironic the ones defending Facebook, either work for them or earn a stable income from them. The can side from the frustrations easier when they are comfortable in life, but when Facebook has the deliberate intentions of doing the opposite.m, which it has proved. Then you know it‚Äôs an absolute bunch of rubbish. It‚Äôs a platform for solely advertising and that is it, everyone else are potential buyers. I purchased a website recently, along with the social network account, noticed that the previous owners where still upto no good on my account, as Facebook clearly stated. Could I get any help, nope. Same pattern from these and business owners around the world, just do as the please when they have made their sales.They just shut the account and that‚Äôs it. All bank details kept all information kept usual stuff no promise of removal of detail.I tried again and had the same problem. Funnily enough I purchased a different device and opened multiple accounts through the browser and they have been left to run.I deliberately did this on a different device, in a different location to the one I reside, ironically they stay open.Facebook either are extremely poor, how anyone could condone such actions from a group is just not comprehendable in 2019, it‚Äôs beyond belief.Great news for politicians though, they can keep advertising their lies.

I had a personal page and a business page attached to it, a beauty blog. I had a lot of subscribers and friends. In October 3, I was logged out of Facebook, asking to send a selfie in order to enter again. I took a photo, attached and sent. The photo was ordinary, without filters, without editing. I waited 2 days, after which, when I tried to go to the page, I received a notification that I was blocked and if I believe that this happened by mistake, then I can send them a personal ID (passport). I took a photo of my passport (I live in Kiev, Ukraine) and sent it. I immediately received a response from Facebook technical support that my page was unlocked, an error occurred and now I can use it again. When I tried to enter Facebook, I got a window ""Your materials are under review."" And I can‚Äôt enter my page since October 3. I tried to write to the support service in the ""Login Problems"" form, tried to write to the technical support mail, with which they answered me about unblocking. I tried to write complaints that they hacked me. Nobody ever answered me. I have already written more than 100 letters, I have never received a response letter and for 3 weeks I can not use my page. Now two words about the reason of the block. On Facebook, I was threatened by one person who used multiple accounts. He was non-Russian and non-Ukrainian, muslim living in Europe, wanted to communicate, demanded intimate photos and threatened to find me to ‚Äúpunish‚Äù. I have all the evidence on mail (he wrote to me on the mail too) and in personal messages on Facebook. I sent requests for technical support on Facebook, which is threatened by a user of your social network, and I did not receive a single answer. Moreover, they blocked me, and this maniac continues to use the social network.A brief conclusion. I hate Facebook, they did not conduct any investigation of my complaints of harassment, they just blocked me, although I have ALL the evidence that I am I, that the page is just mine, that no one hacked me and that I was threatened by a crazy person. Facebook has double standards, I think they left it because the whole page of this crazy person is full of religious quotes and videos, so as not to infringe on his rights. Zuckenberg is only interested in personal profit, and Facebook technical support is either robots or Indians who don‚Äôt even read what users write to them. I changed my mind about Vkontakte - there the administration is 100 times better than the Facebook administration - a live employee will answer you, and your problem will always be solved!",5

I tried to confirm on my computer and CANNOT DO IT. I tried to confirm on my cell AND CANNOT DO IT. The ONLY other way to confirm my login is to contact is to contact five people I have friended on my Facebook page, have them log in to Facebook to get a confirmation code, then send that code back to Facebook to confirm my identity. Who came up with this? What happened to asking for my mother's maiden name, the street address I grew up on, or any other security question the REST OF THE WORLD uses. My ONLY options are confirming on another competer I have used before (which did not work) or bother five of my relatives or friends and get the to confirm my identity. I AM NOT BOTHERING FIVE RELATIVES AND FRIENDS AND HAVE THEM CONFIRM MY IDENTITY. These are the only two options I have about confirming my login.USELESS!",1
13,Pietro Allevato,2019-10-21,1,"Great service from ""I ONLY FLY FIRST‚Ä¶","I tried Facebook for about two weeks because of family pressures to use it to communicate as a group. It worked ok for that, but it also immediately just felt out of control. Aggressively pushing unwanted involvements with other peoples acquaintances and demanding my time to try to manage that, at a pace that I felt uncomfortable with.   It turned into a huge time sucking annoyance.  If you imagine experimenting with heroin, becoming addicted and unable to stop it, Facebook seemed to present the same kind of threat.  I instinctively recoiled from that.  Removing myself from Facebook was much more difficult than I would have hoped for.  It took me several attempts over a period of several days and help from a consultant just to to find the places where I could remove or close my account.   In the many years since, the measure of personal and propaganda risks that Facebook exposes it's account holders and our nations democracy to have become visible.  The addictive nature of it too seems to be real. Only if it's users can and do turn it off, and force Facebook to be responsible for harms done by the content it conveys, will we know whether it can ever be made safe to use.   Disconnect.  Email your friends. You'll free up thousands of hours of your future",5

They murder and kill innocent animals for the fun of it. They do not rescue and save animals what they do is steal people's animals from their yard take them out into the wild and let them loose to be killed by wild animals or they kill them themselves. either way the fact that Facebook allows a terrorist group to be a part of their company is messed up. I really liked Facebook it was a great way for so many things and now it's just total trash. The guy that owns Facebook should be ashamed of himself for supporting a terrorist group. Now that he allowed PETA to be a part of Facebook. PETA is going to use Facebook to stalk people who own animals and will get all their info so they can go to their homes and steal people's pets that they really truly love. And guess what once PETA steals people's pets they will kill them. Facebook is now part of being a terrorist group in a murder,1

Too much power, too much control, and they do not apply the same standards across the board.  They even harassed me for putting a nickname in the middle of my first/last name; that was in 2016.  There are tons of names that aren't people's legal names, but they just couldn't stop themselves from harassing me.They shouldn't be allowed to do what they do, just because they can and everybody and their mother are afraid (or too broke) to file law suits against them.

You can ask again, and provide detail of why it isn't what they claim, but they still return it as hate speech or whatever violation because no one really reads the review.

Facebook brought me relationships, and separated them. It brought me closer to family and friends, and then further apart. I left a few months ago and haven't looked back. The peace and serenity is mindblowing.The most notorious thing about Facebook (apart from Internet trolls, cyber bullies, misuse of data, censorship, the ridiculous amount of adverts, lack of community standards and total political bias) is the utter lack of privacy and security. There are literally NO secrets on Facebook! Let me explain:Anyone can contact you on there or see what you're doing. Literally anyone. From nosy neighbours and interfering relatives to the creepy ex or high school stalker who didn't leave you alone (yeah, they probably watch your profile). Then how about your boss? You probably have pictures or posts you don't want them to see. It's ok you say, your profile is private? They can still watch your friends profiles, or create a fake account and add you. I've even known accounts to be hacked. From there they can find where you live and work, what you do with your spare time and relationship status. And Facebook does literally NOTHING about any of it! From experience, Facebook is for gossiping teenagers and sometimes high school bullies. By the time you get to your mid to late 20's it becomes boring to you, as you can see what it's about. Anyone who is 30+ and logs on to Facebook every day sadly doesn't have much of a life. I'm not saying this to be funny, just honest. I think it's about time Facebook was banned.

MORE and  stupid MORE COMMERICIALS..so many !! By putting them into the feedline now, instead of in the side of page its disrupting the hole flow of using it.The latest promoting for false crypto coins which seem to pop up everywhere now...I had enough !!it lost its simplicity too..The hole lack of privacy thing aside its going DOWN and DOWN in quality.Facebook is sadly now a neverending capitalist engine of business living like a leach on our privacy and sharing with no intention of improving their model to original start of intension.I know from travelling around the world that there is many people who are close on leaving facebook now as its keeps getting worse and our hope that it will listen to users and change for bettter is now looking to never happen. its like when Michael J. Fox in the second movie goes to future and all has gone bad and only selfish commercial greedy interest rule the world. Its so yestersdays stoneage way to live.....so backwards, cold and empty to live in that reality.Even with ton of money you will be feeling lost. Actually even more so..why ?..because when you got it all..and can do all...you sooner or later realize that thats not it ! where did the peace go ? you then overwelmed running around like a rabbit and become more and more numb to life. Feeling like nothing will help...solution is closer than you think...so simple..and your breakdowns is lifes way of showing you..Why does the character, Mark Zuckerberg, wanna play the this lead bad guy role when he can be a hero is beyond my understand. With big privilege comes equal responsibility. To instead be a great part of positive direction in the world.Its always sad to see a good brilliant thing go bad.its  not too late to learn and change, Mark...I can only predict that like most other big companies that dont listen to customers and users in time..it will die slowly ..or suddenly fast...from users finding alternative ways...in this case how to stay in touch. Its easy to create similar sites in this techworld without all these useless things build in. You need a level change..raise it to another level..have a fresh start. WHY NOT ... make Facebook a nonprofit organisation ??WORK for the greater good..Promoting great things and help to make the world take a giant leap into the next evolution of mankind ?Supporting climate and good things in the world ?Its not rocket science.  Dear Mark, Please START the positive change NOW. its time to TRIM facebook and make the changes so we can be happy to use it again...else you know were we going..we will leave and you are left only with all the stupid people around. Fire the stupid people instead !! Its more fun ! Shake the tree !!Like with beauty...simplicity is key....Less is more...TRIM the tree like a bonsai !.. cut..CUT..it will feel much better inside..you know im right. Make it a perfect tool for good !Find back to your original playful essence of creating new things and opening up the world to share and bring us together.

18,Kieren James Saddler,2019-06-08,1,Pathetic and Poor User Support,"I am only writing this review to help feel a bit better and move on from the wasted time and energy that Farcebook has sucked from my life. I have had Facebook on an off for about 6 years, and when I came to University I created a new account to use for societies and so on. I ended up deleting it, and creating a couple of other accounts in succession before having a change of heart and similarly deleting them. No problems there, no harm was done.A few days ago, I try and create a business page on Facebook for a brand that I am setting up. I get told I need to create another personal account in order to do this. No bother, I use the same email address that I have used for all the other platforms which I have created accounts on for my brand. Everything is going fine, the personal account is created (with no profile picture, but I was going to get to that) and I get on with creating the business page. Right in the middle of this I get logged/kicked out and asked to do some security stuff (the details escape me) and then to upload a photo to verify my identity. I do so, and I am happily greeted with a page telling me that I cannot access Facebook at the moment while they verify my photograph to make sure it is me... when there should not be anything on their system which could help identify me in the first place.I waste hours of an evening only to find out that Facebook's user 'support' is one of the greatest and most pathetic jokes on the internet. They ignore pleas for help on Twitter, bury pages in their poor and lazy 'Help Centre' (which is anything but helpful) and if/when staff do get back to you they parrot back responses that appear copy-pasted, lazy and impersonal. When someone does get back to you, they will often say that 'they can't help you' for X or Y and link back to their damn 'Help Centre'. They even ask you to send in a form of identification (e.g. passport) like they are some sort of government agency. They do not tell you directly why your account was disabled, you have to dig and find that out for yourself. You can submit a request to have it reviewed, but you cannot provide any details or a personal message. Not that it would matter, you'd likely get an automated reply. No chat support system, no clear email address to contact, negligent support on the likes of Twitter on top of the censorship and manipulation of the public mean that I will never go near Facebook again and neither should you. If I do manage to get back into my account (emphasis on the 'If') I will go straight to deleting my account.I never felt the need to create a Trustpilot account before, but Mr. Zuckerburg was that impetus.",1

6,Joy,2019-05-14,10,I joined Facebook back in 2007 and it‚Ä¶,"I joined Facebook from my daughter request to be ""connected with family and friends"" over ten years ago. My daughter still lives in Estonia while I have been ""homeless traveller"" in southern part of Europe. After joining, I started to get several friend request from the persons from my childhood and my previous life to be connected using this service. That's what this platform supposed to be? As tolerant person, I sometimes accepted ""friend requests"" from strangers, but in first attempt to sellme some ""unsecured loans"" or present views outside my acceptance level, I immediately unfriend those and blocked for further attempts and toread my posts. That's what I call a censorship? In 2009 I met some guys introducing Facebook SDK for me. As I had figured out, that some ""StartUp""s music discovery algorithms are not the best, I had an idea for my own music discovery app and as Facebook promised their data for me to use, I took the hook. However, this was a bad decision as Facebook constantly removed features used and finally started to demand ""credit card and utility bills"" from me? It was a free app and never in my life, I haven't been involved such kind of scam like ""credit card"". And I purchase my cooking gas from bottles and one solar panel should be enough for my electricity needs, even I wrote this app in public library. Next time they want my grocery shopping list before they can make the decision, is my app OK? That demand clearly shows that their objective is not to be connected with your friends and family, but to sell you questionable agreements and ""unsecured loans"". So, I had to rewrote my algorithm to use device music library instead (as recommended by Apple staff at first place) and this improved my algorithm results a lot. I still had Facebook SDK binary included to my app, until somebody notified me about SpyWare in my app, so I had to remove this and afterwards at least my app is SpyWare free. However, I still had invested to this app, my book and film project Facebook pages, so I hoped that maybe those are useful to marketing purposes. That was again false hope. The $100 campaign to my book didn't result not a single purchase and even I has link to my app page inside my app, this made lot of visits but not a single like. By replacing it with the link to my app AppStore page, it started to get ratings and reviews there. But I still had a platform to be connected with my friends and family? Not much longer as Facebook started a campaign to redefine Estonian language and Culture. At first, I was surprised that all my friends are constantly getting 30 days ban to post for stupid reasons. So have Facebook defined Estonian National Eepos to be ""hate speech"", awarded and respected Estonian writers are getting banned to promote their work, people are punished by their political views, being a Christian is punished there, etc. For me the final blow was, when Facebook decided that post from years ago, which isn't even mine as I had shared it, is rassistic because it contained a word ""murjam"". ""Murjam"" is the word from my childhood children books, where we learned how children in Africa are living and where very popular on those days. And it got another meaning, when we as children went outdoors to play and returned with our muddy and dirty clothes, so our mom told us: ""you look like a murjam"". So, being aware of childrens in other culture is defined ""rassistic"" nowadays?So, I informed my friends that Facebook has banned to use words ""murjam"" and ""tibla"" in their platform. And in minutes I was banned to post or comment at all? Obviously Facebook employees nowadays reading every post and discussion! As there is still Institute of Estonian Language and Culture, who defines words meanings and not mr. Zuckenberg! I had even Iincluded links to Estonian official language dictionary to that post. But as any dictator acts, their decisions are the only one which are right decisions! Previously, I assumed that Facebook censors are looking for posts somebody has reported to them, but seems that they listen and go back for anything you have discussed inside your friends and family. Even Soviet KGB didn't much care what and how you are discussing inside your friends and family, so it Facebook had made the society much worse than it was during authoritarian regimes by it's SpyWare, constant monitoring of private discussions and even selecting, what kind of words we are allowed to use! I would call mr. Zuckenberg a ""tibla"", because that what this word in Estonian language means. It's a person, who does not care about other nations and cultures and becomes to demand, that everything should be as they wanted by their rules. Even becoming to Estonian language during Soviet occupation era, it does not refer only to Russians, but it refers to persons from any arrogant nations!",1

I sought help from Facebook support and they ""tried"" helping me out (though their response was ""yeah, I'll look into it and get back to you!"" and then their next email several days later was ""We're still waiting for your reply, are you satisfied with the support you recieved?"" and my response was ""You said you would look into it and get back to me"" and then they said ""oh, right.

9,Chantelle Graham,2019-05-13,3,Yikes,I have been using Facebook since the beginning and it used to be a nice experience all the updates it's causing all the problems in the errors and no way to get ahold of them except the email I mean they spend millions of dollars on this software that's all link together with all these professionals that work for them working on this it seems to me they're doing more of the work for their selves than they are for their customers they keep saying that they're working on a solution to the problem but it seems that they're fixing more of the other problems they have which are'nt really problems for us or really them. Don't get me wrong I'm sure they have plenty of problems but all I'm saying is all the updates that they do why are they causing the problems for us and why do they update so often sometimes it's two or three times a week and just when you get used to something they change it and then it doesn't really work that well anyway take for instance the posts that you can delete numerous posts you can delete that thing has caused more errors and took more time than if I would have deleted my posts one at a time and Marketplace don't even get me started on Marketplace you go to load pictures when you sell something and it just boots you back out to the beginning to your homepage over and over again until finally it works if you don't give up oh I could go on and on and on and on Facebook really needs to address the issues at their customers and I need a better way to get in contact with them they have all the professionals and evidently they're not listening to us. I  don't use Facebook nearly as much as I used to that's just what it's come down to and you can blame it all on Facebook.

And the service did not cost any money, but people did not understand it was not money you paid with but your personal information that could then be sold on to the highest bidder, and when they did understand they still used it.Facebook claimed to be a platform, a town square where all views could be aired and discussed, this meant they were not responsible for the content posted on their site, so if some views led to people being harmed they disavowed all liability, but then they started banning people for wrong think, those people that did not think in the far left manner, those people that resisted and went against the narrative published in the Media or spouted by Leftist Governments.They started to censor people. Labour & Conservative MP's started pushing Facebook to do what they say to follow their ideological rubbish, then they started blocking what people said, ban people, even delete posts that dared to mention certain names or post pictures of them. Then came the mass bans of people that did not follow what Facebook wanted to do, the election meddling started, not allowing people to have their democratic voice even if they had not broken any rules. Facebook turned from a Platform to a Publisher, a Publisher is responsible for what people say on their site, Facebook would be liable for the death threats, fanatical incitement to violence and the liable statements made by companies, political parties, newspapers, media channels, comedians and everyone else that posts.Facebook are now a publisher not a platform, and they should be counted as such by Governments and Organizations across the planet, you cannot have it both ways Facebook, you want to control what is said then your a PUBLISHER not a Platform who is interfering in Democratic Elections and CENSORING valid opinions.Facebook will claim some people have broken their terms of service, just look at Far Leftist or Religious fanatic pages, see the vile comments, death threats and incitement to violence, Facebook are not censoring these people.If you like Freedom of Speech, then leave Facebook and join Telegram, Minds, Gab and Bitchute, let Facebook disappear into the void of the internet.Bin Censorbook‚Ä¶.",1

4,Romy,2019-01-28,6,NO REAL CUSTOMER CARE!! what kind of service provider is this??,"So I have been using Facebook for 10 years now mainly due to peer and family and this is the first time I thought I should rate this. I totally do NOT like the way FB works. It is a social media platform, yes. Initially it was only for social networking but it has been almost 5-6 years it has become a highly commercial place for social media influencers. The Facebook users are not seen as socialising people but only as highly capitalistic consumers, nothing more than that. And the WORST part is unlike all other big companies, FB does not have a real consumer forum, or customer care. If you fall into any trouble or if you want to complain about anything in FB, there is no real person who will handle the issue and you will keep getting an automated response forever. All of it does not sound a big deal right? No, it is a big deal. Anything without a judiciary system should not be trusted. I fell into trouble with FB regarding the payments through FB. They blocked my payments suspecting me as fraud when all I did was to claim a refund from paypal for a valid reason. Now no matter how many times I write them to unblock my payments on FB, it cannot be done. Why because there is no one to resolve this matter, literally no one. I keep getting automated responses that my payment has been deactivated due to security reasons. I cannot talk to anyone, I cannot explain anything. All I could do was upload my id and still receive the same response. And it is annoying. A good service provider has to have a resolution centre, a real one not automated mail sending robots. No customer service means it has no respect whatsoever for its customers and Facebook gives a damn if you are not happy with their service.",1

Until just recently, when I decided to join and give it a go. My children have all Facebook accounts for several years now.So my daughter helped me to create the account, I uploaded a good photo, and invited others to join my account. After like two days I received a mail from Facebook that my account was suspended. What??? Why? one may ask.We tried to contact Facebook admin to find out, u cannot contact them easily. They sent a generic e-mail where u can put your complain, blah,blah...that's it. It is most probably connected somewhere...God knows where...to a remote computer, somewhere in Timbuktu, which will send u a very generic answer. It is programmed like that, so they don't need to worry and solve issues.My account is still suspended. I have no chance to find out how to rectify it, or what they want, or what u need to do. Nothing of the kind.Some personnel touch to the problem would be good. Nothing. No number to ring, no person to talk. And for them this is a normal way of conducting the business. As they have now billions of people on their account obviously they will not care if they lose one or two.I am not sure even if they read these reviews, most probably they don't give a damn what anyone thinks.I had to give one star, until I hear back from them, from someone...anyone as a matter of fact.

My understanding is that an appeal is considered final in terms of internal dispute resolution. If someone contests the basis of that appeal, does Facebook use binding arbitration or litigation? The terms (rights and responsibilities) indicate that Facebook no longer uses binding arbitration and instead requires disputes to be resolved in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County. I Have Confidence That We Will Win The Civil Suit Because Facebook Doesn‚Äôt Execute And Enforce Their Policies And Guildlines Equally They Are Bias And We Have Screenshots And Screen Recording Of Things Things That I Know Are A Violation Of Facebook Guildlines Because I HAVE READ THEM YET THESE POST WE HAVE SCREENSHOTS AND SCREEN RECORDINGS OF BEEN UP FOR YEARS, MONTHS, AND NOTHING IS BEING DONE TO THEMCould you please let me know:Is the disable account appeal the final internal process for disputing a disabled account, or are there other internal escalations one can use prior to moving to external dispute resolution processes?Is the appropriate external dispute resolution process litigation at the above mentioned locations?Thank you for your assistance. The FAQ and community help forums were unable to answer these questions above, and getting in touch with someone from Facebook for answers has been challenging.  Yes My Client Demario White Facebook Profile Was Disabled Thursday 10/11/18, Demario Sent In His IDs His Account Was Unlocked. Yesterday 10/16/18 He Was Disabled Again! It‚Äôs Obvious He Is Getting Disabled As A Result Of False Reporting. My Client Just Forwarded Me A Email Saying His Account Was Disabled For Socliciting Others And Sexual Suggestive Content, But He Also Forwarded Me A Screen Capture Of What It Says When He Tries To Login. When He Got Logged Out And Tried To Log Back In It Yesterday It Said He Had Been Disabled For Impersonation. Which He Sent Me Evidence That He Sent In His IDs 10 Times For The Same Thing On Different Occasions. Now You All Are Saying Something Totally Different It‚Äôs Very UNACCEPTABLE. My Client Got Disabled Twice In Less Than A Week, After The Account Was Restored. It‚Äôs Obviously It‚Äôs False Reporting That Being Done To Him. Whats Really Going On Here? He Has Been Disabled 10 Times, Even After Being Verified With A Blue Check. My Client Demario White Feel He Is Getting Disabled And Bullied. He Runs Paid Ads On His Pages And Is Always Live On His Profile. How Do He Keep Getting Disabled For Being A Impersonation Account Especially That He VERIFIED. This Is Defamation On Facebook, He is Losing Fans Also He Feel He Is Constantly Targeted Because Of False Reporting And Facebook Isn‚Äôt Doing NOTHING ABOUT IT. I Will Be Filing A Court Order On His Behalf If This Is Taken Care Of By 10-18-18. He Feel He Is Being Targeted And It‚Äôs DISCOURAGING AND DISCRIMINATIVE.

Apart from fumbling around trying to learn how to adjust settings etc. ( 63 year old tech illiterate) I'd made one comment to a fellow Australian regarding a Telco we share. I passed on information I'd received from the authorities and advised him to check it out for himself. I don't know if that upset anyone but for some reason I was suspended while they investigated suspicious activity. I was then asked for a photo which immediately made me think it was purely a personal information gathering exercise. I sent them a very clear photo of me showing how many minutes it would take me to delete my account. One minute in fact. I think they misinterpreted the gesture as an angry old Australian guy thinking he's been conned into giving up more personal information. My account was then disabled. So no way to delete the account. I then sent them a photo of my licence with details other than my name, date of birth and photo covered, all matching my account details and previous photo, just to get in and delete the account and it's still disabled. I have now sent them a note saying if they don't delete the account it's the only thing I'll be doing so hopefully that will be the end of it. Just a total con job to gather people's personal information. I should've added as for service not one email advising me of what's going on. The only way I find out anything is by trying to log on. (14-12 update) I've now sent several requests asking for my account to be deleted and had no response despite their guidelines saying they will delete accounts when asked. Still not one email from them. The Australian Government needs to have a look at this company. It's out of control.",1

It's easy to forget that I'm already doing this at considerable cost for zero financial return, so I'm justifiably reluctant to pay to promote my stuff which is already free. Meanwhile, I'm looking through my feed and all I'm seeing is ads, ads, and more ads, which I do not consider to be social network content.

9,Mr J Stevens,2018-10-11,8,DO FACEBOOK CARE AT ALL ABOUT THEIR (potential)  USERS?,"I wanted to transfer a TRUSTPILOT review I wrote about TESCO MOBILE to TESCO's FACEBOOK page, so thought I would register with FACEBOOK. However when I filled in all the details and hit the button to register the screen blanked out completely and that was that. Tried again, same result. I contacted FACEBOOK support, explained exactly what I was having problems with and they did nothing. About a week later I was looking through my secret passwords book, when I noticed some login details for a FACEBOOK account I had forgotten I had set up years ago. Wonderful.  I thought I would be OK now. I tried to log in with the details in my secret passwords book, but before I was allowed in I had to firstly request a code to be sent to me, which I did. I was then told to enter that code into a box on the login page to prove I was who I was saying I was. Apparently the fact I had the correct username and password means nothing to FACEBOOK. Anyway I entered the code, and the next barrier FACEBOOK threw up in front of me was to absolutely insist I submitted a photo. I was starting to wonder by this point if I really needed to use FACEBOOK at all. But I persevered telling  myself it would be easy after this hurdle was cleared? So I got my mobile out and took a photo, sent it in an email to myself on my computer, then uploaded it to the box on the login page. The first photo was rejected for some unknown reason. I was told it was rejected, and told to upload a photo with nobody else in it. Well the first photo had nobody else in it, but who are we to argue with Facebook, even if we could? So I repeated the whole procedure all over again, and this time the photo was not rejected, but instead I was told FACEBOOK were going to review my selfie, and ONCE THEY HAD VERIFIED IT WAS A PICTURE OF ME they would let me into my account.  Bear in mind I had already entered my username and password to prove who I was. Then They sent me a code to the email address I had used as a username , when I set up the account. I entered that code correctly and it was accepted. So that's twice I had proved I was me. Then we get all this nonsense about photos being compulsory and requiring VERIFICATION by some unknown means!. I am still waiting a week later for them to verify my photo is genuine!. The big question I want the answer to is HOW DOES FACEBOOK VERIFY A PHOTO OF A USER IS GENUINE? Do they have links with the POLICE or SECURITY  SERVICES, LIKE MI5 or similar.? Anyway I am still waiting to be allowed into my totally legitimate account. If anyone at Facebook reads this can you possibly let me into my account, and also tell us how do you verify a photo is a true likeness of a potential user? I am sure they could throw some more barriers in front of us if they tried harder. Maybe next year, or next week?",2

For me I find it so hard to believe that such a large company as Facebook, doesn‚Äôt have in place a technical team that service users can connect with either via live chat or emails. This is a basic necessity, so why is this????Although they provide a form for you to report issues, the simple fact is that they do not do anything, rather after a short period of time your issue is closed down without anything being done. So what‚Äôs the point????Having the correct details displayed regarding any business is a very important factor to growth of any busnesss,  so why can‚Äôt Facebook rectify this issue????  What makes it worse, is that the issue is also affecting other social media platforms such as Instagram. Clients either can‚Äôt find me or they end up check-in inton a location with the incorrect address.All I‚Äôm going to say is that from my experience, unless you are a multimillionaire company that generates millions.

Yet, for millions of people it appears to remain 'cool' to have a Facebook page.  I think 'how uncool...to comply with the establishment that treats us all like animals in a zoo'.Facebook clearly functions as an arm of State surveillance and censorship, regularly responding to whatever political whims of the day are issued from Washington as the US aspires to world super-bully status.

She then files fraudulant copyright reports on anyone that uses the original photo!!! The photo she STOLE!

And there's no way to contact Facebook about this problem and even if you manually file a counter claim they tell you to contact the person who made the report!

When people aren't waxing lyrical about how terrible the hand they've been dealt is, they're showing themselves off in the best possible light through the use of carefully chosen pictures which nine times out of ten, has a filter applied. One could lead you to believe that they had life of grandeur and never-ending love when in actuality it's an existence of trying to look good in the eyes of others and nothing more. A sad reality for many.Detoxing from Facebook after an admittedly severe addiction has been similar to that of when a Pornstar finds Christ, it opens up a world of time, energy and freedom you never knew you had and brings to light just how damaging social media can be and whilst Facebook can be and is great for keeping in touch with people, the truth is‚Ä¶ So is a phone call. In 2018, Facebook stands as a hive-mind of narcism and negativity ran by the poster child of humanoid reptilians himself, Mark Zuckerberg.

You'll connect with friends, friends of friends and that one guy who you avoid at work but add for the simple fact that it makes you seem more popular, the fun never ends and years from now when humanity is even more self absorbed than before, where ""likes"" and ""follows"" are a legitimate currency and modern trends are as fickle and ill-thoughtout as the UK government, we'll have Facebook to primarily thank.

3,Jan,2018-04-14,6,Facebook is the creepiest invention from this millennium,"Facebook is the creepiest invention from this millennium. This online 'social' network is to a large extend shielded from the rest of the open internet, like a dark web community. Facebook wants you. You have to be a member of their elite network, uploading your real photo and completing your profile in order to view the majority of it. Unfortunately most people of my age and even many older folks that I know are not so smart; they are FB members. They feel the need to eat this 'free lunch' and share photo's of their relationships, kids, holidays, important life events, like this and that, answer where they've studied, fill in where they grew up etc. Even my (questionable?) physician and former teachers are now part of this network, sharing photo's of their private lives. What they don't (want to) understand is that FB is not a free service. These people trade a social network service for everything they upload on FB. These people don't care or don't know that FB's intention is to sell all member data to governments, institutions and businesses around the globe. These people want to be slaves of the system, they want to be manipulated in the surveillance state that this world is increasingly becoming, thanks to mass data hoarding. They want to wake up in a system where their insurance is going to say: ''hey Kyle, I recently read your FB post about fitness, how about we give you a discount on your premium?'' and ''hey Tailor, you haven't been so transparent these recent months online, how about we increase your premium?''. Or how about Taylor's ex partner or unsatisfied customer who decides it's time to ruin her life forever online? These attention seekers want that world. And you know what? They will get it one day, but then it's too late..",1

Facebook waited until I had become involved in a numberof groups and pages, before shutting down my profile with no warning whatsoever. They requested I send them proof of who I was - but would not accept any explanation as to why I couldn't send the proof they requested (basically, a passport or drivers license photocopy).All I recieved was an automated response that was barely disguised as being from a real person, stating the information I had given them was not a valid passport or license copy.I eventually sent them a copy of my passport , just so they would read an e-mail I had sent to them, and to confirm that I was a real person and not some strange stalker-type weirdo who had set up a new profile to hurt someone. I also included links to my online store that clearly shows the name I use as being identical to that of the Facebook profile I had set up, as well as yet another eplanation as tothe name being used..The reply was almost inane compared to the question I had asked about reinstating my profile.""You need a page"" they stated -nothing else ... no explanation on how to get my profile reinstated, or reason as to why it was disabled in the first place. No true conversation has been achieved with Facebook - just automated replies that pretend to be from a real person. Since December 2017, they won't even reply to my e-mails at all. Apparently, I don't exist (much the same as their customer service).Facebook does not care about their users - they just want to make money.They ban pages and profiles for unjust reasons, and yet let paedophiles and criminals do 'business' through their site.They need to put the human face back into facebook, and start interacting realistically with their users.Sadly, I am still  facebook user, using a differnt proile- but only to keep in contact with some family.

2,Honest Reviews,2018-01-13,11,Waste of time,"Facebook had the good intention of connecting friends and family seamlessly no matter how far away, however it has become a platform for abuse and extremists. You can't join a single group without having to hear someone's personal views and beliefs shoved down your throat, should you disagree with or have a different view you will receive abusive personal messages and comments left on the page. Obvious facts and scientific evidence is disregarded in favour or personal belief, and people create groups just to start a cult. I've had people claim, science means nothing, and it don't matter if someone is committing fraud as long as it makes people feel better. Avoiding the groups on things you love, interests, hobbies, bands, stars, etc is the way to go.  The only thing Facebook is good for is finding friends of family you have lost contact with, (or people you are stalking) but even then you will need to know there full married names and or locations. Being that you have lost contact with these people you probaly won't have this information, making it only good for stalking people you know details of. Which leads me to, if you have an abusive ex, ex friend, or just a stalker who wishes to know your personal life and or give you grief best you struggle with the hundreds of different settings to make your profile invisible to anyone not already on your friends list, again making anyone with good intent trying to find you impossible. Furthermore,  they changed the messaging service so you now have to install another app and risk all your personal information on another platform. No one ever gets banned or punished for there rude, extreme or aggressive abusive messages. You can block people so they cannot abuse you further but this does not stop there extremist views being pushed on and threats being made to others.They also try to force you to upload I.D of yourself personally so they can verify your name, this seems hugely inappropriate and they should just accept they created a platform for trolls and abuse and should shut down there website if they cannot control the problem not police the users like a corrupt government.The only real actual use of Facebook is communicating between friends and family, which you could use a phone for and as such bypass all of the other problems with this service.",2

Facebook provides one of the worst customer service experiences of any major company on Earth. There is quite literally no way to reach anyone live any longer. And certainly no way to reach any of the decision makers in their executive offices. The attitude has pretty much always been if you don't like what they're offering you for free you're free to go elsewhere. The typical arrogance of any company that has an effective monopoly.Facebook continually makes so-called improvements that seem more designed for the enjoyment of the hackers who run the place than for its users. What most Facebook users really want is for some multi-billionaire like Richard Branson to come along and start a company that can pose a real challenge to Facebook by listening to users while offering a similar experience.

5,TB A-214686,2017-07-27,7,Unacceptable in every way.,"Today I bought a pair of Rayban Sunglasses at Solid Gold Jewellers in Bugibba.The price was 173‚Ç¨ but I got a discount and paid 155‚Ç¨.I walked to my hotel about half a mile from the shop, changed in my room and went to the pool. When I laid down on sunbed I took of my new sunglasses and one if the nose supports stuck to my nose.Bad luck I thought and walked back to the shop after about 2 hours by the pool ‚Äì so I was back about 4 hours after I bought the sunglasses. I was asked to go to another shop, the main shop further up the street.When I got there the two girls in the shop first tried to but the nose support back on but was unable and offered to repair the sunglasses, but then I would have to wait a day or so.I asked for a replacement or a refund. They did not have the same model and they offered me to pick another pair of sunglasses, which I went on to do.While I was looking at other sunglasses they found a scratch, they were unable to show me this scratch but both the girls said there was a scratch. Now back in my hotel I am still unable to find the scratch.They now refused to take the sunglasses back and again offered to repair them. Since I am unable to wait for the repair that was not an option.So, I am left with a pair of unusable, but quite expensive sunglasses for the rest of my vacation. I bought, what I thought was a quality pair of sunglasses to avoid them breaking and I bought them at what appeared to be a real store and not just a tourist trap ‚Äì clearly, I was wrong.I did get very upset by the treatment and I would wish there was grounds for legal actions including reporting the shop to the police. However, it seems quite obvious that this is not a matter for neither the police or the judicial system (no matter how upset I am) ‚Äì it is simply a case of bad business ethics.Consequently, all I can do is to warn and discourage anyone from trading at either of the solid gold stores in Bugibba.",1
6,Amy,2017-07-27,3,My profile page gets over-spammed with ‚Ä¶,"Facebook is a popular social-networking site created in 2004 by 19 year old Mark Zukerberg.  Facebook has helped users like me connect with family members, old classmates of many years ago, friends and people of my choosing based on shared interest. Also, it allows me to share my best pictures and see what friends think of it on the comment and like section. Facebook has a section for users to say what's on their mind and express their mood at any point in time and also, text and post videos. It is a really great way to engage your leisure and also grow your business!  I am able to play games, watch videos, customise my page, share favorite product information, ""like"" favorite celebrities and social causes, live-stream video, connect with goods and services, and live-chat via Messenger.                               Facebook's versatility and so much functionality has saved lots of people via it's marketing platform where companies can reach a wider audience of about 1.6billion registered users from all over the world! statistics provided by Facebook for instance  reveals that as of March 2014 there were 1.28 billion active users on the site per month, and at least 802 million of these users logged into Facebook every day. With statistics such as these, it is not surprising that Facebook is the most popular Social Networking Site in the world.                                                                      In conclusion,  Facebook has saved as a diary for me, I get to write events and post pictures and can view my progressions over the years anytime I feel like, also, with facebook, my business has been able to spread to a wider audience and I keep in touch with friends and family. Facebook is simply awesome!",1

It is a great social media site in which friends can easily get together. This is contrasted by - 2. It is supposed to be a censored site. I am no prude but some of the language used I can't accept. I remember some time ago, I requested Facebook intervene. My request message was ignored. With that, I promptly closed my Facebook account (I thought).3. Some time later, I discovered that, even though I thought the account was closed and I'm not using it, it was still active. Because of this, I considered I may as well use it again.4. Lately, I have been getting many messages from Facebook, saying, ""Your account has been logged into from near ..........."". Very interesting,  because I have not been to these places, some of which are 400 kilometres (250 miles) away. These are obviously illegal logins or a major discrepancy. Either way, Facebook don't want to know about it or offer any advice. So, how do I fix the problem? No-one knows. I could find no phone number or e-mail address, to contact. I even wrote ('snail-mail') to Facebook. I expected them to realize I was serious in trying to find a 'fix' to the apparent problem. This was approximately a month ago and I'm still waiting for a reply (or even, an acknowledgement).It appears that Facebook have no intention of enforcing their own rules. Also, there appears to be no way of getting accurate advice from them.Yes, Facebook is interesting and socially, great. No, I still can't recommend it.",1

Passed from pillar to post, promised that I would be put in touch with someone so I could submit a request for compensation for the time I was unable to access my account, but the only suggestion they had (despite numerous chases from me) was to submit ""feedback"" via their generic form which may/may not be dealt with. After specifically asking to be put in touch with someone who could help, I was subsequently ignored completely. We spend ¬£100's per month on Facebook ads and it's not the service I expect. We are a charity, so this is a total waste of donors money which could be going towards recruiting the volunteers we so desperately need to carry out our work. Unforgiveable.",1

Apparently Facebook has come up saying I have been to various venues with this lady in 2015 and 2016. I have had no notification of this and have not seen the lady concerned for about 5 years when she changed jobs. The only exceptions to this were when I was picking my wife up from where she had been doing some voluntary work and the lady walked in. The other was when I was working as a guide on the Bristol Insight Open Top bus and I was seen by her and she rushed up the stairs gave me a quick kiss, in front of the customers, and rushed off. She had her small grand daughter with her.My wife has accused me of seeing her on a number of occasions and this has caused a rift in our marriage.Facebook has said that I went to St Mart Redcliffe Church with the lady. I have walked past the church and also parked outside of it when going into work. I haven't entered the church for at least 10 years.I am considering taking legal action against Facebook and have permanently deleted my account.",1

I dedicated a lot of hours on Facebook as it was part of my High School, University, 1st Job and its still playing the same outstanding role in my life.As you guys continue gathering people with different culture and backgrounds into one place to share ideas and discuss thoughts that can actually create a difference in people life`s.But so far for the last 3 years i didn`t found a lot of changes in the platform it self as you guys still do a lot of upgrades and add new features and always we are ""MENA region"" the last who gets provided by these upgrades. This is not fair treatment also not what i expected from a platform that i trust my personal data and my life updates on. So if you guys don`t want us to abandon your platform ""Its already happening"" you better do some serious changes in the platform services. We need to feel that this platform is creative again.",4

People can duplicate your profile picture without any approval, and it's not against facebook's community standard . In Facebook, there is no regulation about ""if you use gender as male, you should put name as a boy or a man not as a woman"".People also can share any pornograph picture or video, Facebook will removed it if someone report it, it's too late for it-you know. Facebook should prevent before its share, not after its share.I really dissapointed for this, and I hope facebook reviewed my review as an advice for facebook's better tomorrow.Thanks",5

However, one think is missing, and it's kinda critically essential: just let me see who's seen my posts, just like what 'that other social networking app' do (sorry for comparing, but frankly, this feature is what I seek for eternity!). It's like:You see your posts, and the posts let you know who's seen your posts, because rhetorically, Facebook users just look at the posts, and scroll down. That's it, no trace: no likes, comments, etc. So, it keeps me wondering, is my post unnoticed?In conclusion, just let the users see who has seen their posts (like: seen by X friends). And, I'm really sorry for comparing this with 'that other social networking app', but seriously, this may really helpful for anyone who's living their life with 'like-less/comment-less' posts, including me.It's OK if our posts aren't liked/commented.

11,Hiroshi Mishima,2016-02-11,8,"Great Concept, Terrible Execution","The core idea of Facebook is being able to get all the people you know into one place where you can keep tabs on, talk to, and otherwise share experiences with no matter where you are in the world. Imagine a forum where everyone in the world has access at the touch of a button.Now imagine tons of spam, unwanted suggestions, creepy strangers, invasive security and Big Brother also here in this one place because that's exactly what Facebook is today. Not only does it often feel like absolutely anyone can look at and like your child's posts (shared with friends from school), but sometimes even personal information gets shown publicly during one of the various moments when Facebook breaks something.I LOVE that Facebook allowed me to get in contact with people I used to go to school with, and family that I hadn't heard from in forever. What chaffs is all the garbage Farmville posts, friend suggestions with total strangers, and the constant pressure to share every single song, actor or pizza topping I've ever liked. And you can't tell it ""No"", because Facebook doesn't listen to ""No"". It hears, ""ask me later"", which it will do the next time you come by. You can hide posts, you can block people, but you can't ever get rid of Facebook's persistence without.. you know.. actually leaving.Their mobile app sounded nice at first, too, but they kept updating and changing and making unnecessary tweaks or needing access to who knows what on your phone, so I dropped that over a cliff.However, as I said, at its core Facebook is both useful and a really great idea. There's a lot of people who use the service so the odds of someone you know being there are quite high, making it easy to look up old friends or displaced relatives.",3

This is called censorship.Another pristine example of this repetitive behaviour was when I reported the abusive behaviour of a hotel manager that kept sending extremely offensive and defamatory messages via Facebook. Once again, it got reported to Facebook and they ignored it. The case was judged in court and the hotel manager was ordered to pay compensation for the damages caused to myself.Standards should be applied to everyone.

4,George Morina,2015-01-06,6,The must valuable social network in the planet!,"I started using Facebook since 2005 but full time since 2007,I am more than happy with Facebook, it is the must powerful channel to deliver the messages to the public with fully focus on generic strategy. I have manage to receive  1.9 billion Impressions in the whole network  by  468 million social media  Users  with in 3 years 2011-2014  proven from trusted Social Media analytic's.Facebook it is great for Generic Brands, but not very easy for commercial brands who use commercial contents, as we know the costumer service it is very far from the standard based on the number of users and the number of people Facebook has employ. (Employees 8,348 September 2014) 864 million daily active users on average for September 2014! It means for every 100.000 users it is only one costumer service, and this it creates massive gab to communicate direct with Facebook costumer service. Other problem for online businesses who use Facebook to promote brands is that many brands  use wrong strategy where they focus on building large number of fans, instead of building interactions and communicating with the  fans and sharing idea how to improve the services, we must understand ,branding it is much cheaper than marketing.Some of the Users who use Facebook to chat and link with friends and families, they think Facebook is dating site  that is massive mistake.We must remember Facebook it works same as we chat and talk with people on real life, and is no need to think Oh I am on Facebook and I can talk and do whatever I like as no one can see me , and no one know about me.(if you try to use fake name) what is the point? who going to take you serious,? No one like to talk and chat with stranger, this is not the right thing to do on Facebook.

6,Rari,2014-08-28,4,Why did I ever think this website was great?,"After using facebook since 2009, I have seen a massive decline in both content and usage in the past year or two.At first you may think 'Great! A popular way to keep up with friends' Well, that would be the case if the website wasn't filled with disturbing content and links to malicious websites. Are the posts not controlled on here?I have seen numerous links, images and videos on this website that can be quite triggering or just generally disturbing. That is not the only thing that can be found here. Sexism, Racism, Bullying and more are quite frequent on facebook. After numerous reports and still nothing being done to remove or monitor content, That's when alarm bells start ringing.The only reason I continue to use Facebook on the odd occasion is too keep up with friends and family who I have no other way too communicate, It would be nicer if the posts were more monitored though.For me, Facebook is more trouble then its worth, If you don't want the drama or are easily disturbed or can be quite vulnerable, I would recommend staying away from here.",1

Sometimes people show online despite logging off hours ago, I've been told I was online when I was sent a message, even though I wasn't. Should've left it at being able to deactive chat / have it activated, no more. I have days where I don't want to talk, if I accidently click a message that was unopened, that other person is either gonna be sad or pester me.I like the facebook minigames, and I like the overall design. I'd really wish that the people who don't like to play games could disable ALL game invites. It's not easy to pick 20 people out by names on your friendlist, whenever you send those mass-game requests which the mini-games offer.

15,Glyn,2012-04-07,7,"Am I rating it or me? Both, I believe.","I was pulled into Facebook by an email from someone who wanted me to be his 'friend'. He was already my friend, so I had no idea what he was going on about, however I followed the link, intending to give him some click to confirm rather than ignore him, but found I actually had to Join the thing to do so. I was tempted to phone him to say 'nothing personal, but you're going to have to accept that i am your friend, without my having to join some official club in order to prove it to you'.However, I decided to join, in the unlikely event that it might be in any way of interest to me. That seemed to put me on some kind of a map, and I was soon getting emails from more people wanting me to be their 'friend'. Each time, I had to find and apply my login details in order to validate the friendship I thought they already had with me. After a few months, these interruptions began to dwindle, and I only have to log in about once every three months.Occasionally, I am told that people have 'written things on my wall', so I log in. It is a lot of effort to do things which can more easily be done by phone, email or forum. Worse still, I seem to be in the centre of irrelevant, even idiotic information trying to grap my attention of my clicks. Somebody was desperate to get a virtual ingredient to make a virtual cocktail in order to get a virtual-bartenders' certificate. What collyrot! But I wincingly and, I admit, patronizingly decided to click to assist them in their pointless ambition; and found that to do so, I had to liberate my entire address book to the organizers of the virtual bar, presumably so that I become implicated in spreading this.Therefore, I go on Facebook only when I am called, am unimpressed each time, and I log off ASAP.There are, however, many millions of people who like spending time on it - it obviously 'works'. Even some of my real-life friends tell me that it helps them to 'keep in touch'.When reviewing, I typically feel secure and confident that I am assessing the quality of a 'thing in itself'. But, regarding Facebook, I realise I am reviewing a product which works, but which I have no interest in, like a chicken-sexing kit. The serious difference between Facebook and chicken-sexing kits, both of which, I assume, achieve their objectives, is that the latter does not force itself into my awareness, nor recruit my friends to be part of its marketing.",3

4,Richard,2012-03-27,17,"Buggy, slow, and what about my privacy","I only use Facebook because I have to. It is not an experience I enjoy. It's like queuing up at the cinema to buy a drink, knowing you're about to get a good rogering by the cinema staff for what is essentially water (free) and sugar (next to free). But, you're there to have a 'good time', and your friends are looking on, and maybe you even have a date so it would look weird if you didn't get a drink.I mean, sure, people would understand, and they would say 'oh no, its good that you didn't - they're not good value' but they still think you're weird. And such is the same of Facebook.Everyone is Facebook, everything happens on Facebook, I can't imagine a Facebookless life simply because its where I talk to my friends, acquaintences, find out about goings on and generally keep up with social circle. I use google+ too, which is fun, but it doesn't have the adoption required to be a required website.So, what's wrong with facebook? It can be slow, a lot of the time. It can be buggy, a lot of the time. Whenever I chat to someone, I need to close the browser and reopen it every 5 or 6 minutes, because its crashed the process. Yet my google talk in gmail can be left on all day.I don't like the lack of transparency or the cognition of privacy on facebook. They basically say 'The settings are there! It's up to you!' but they ASSUME that you want to share. This means, if you absent mindedly click (like 90% of people), you will end up sharing fairly quickly. It's like the opt-in / opt-out organ donor debate. Except, giving facebook the right to share my stuff is less high on the priority list than giving little Jimmy what's left of my retinas after I succumb to a horrible but thankfully brief death at the hands of an overworked and underpaid bus driver who wasn't looking the right way at the right time.Facebook works. I use it every day because I don't have an alternative.But I don't like it.",3

Facebook would benefit a lot if they just left it alone.

14,Elena Ashton,2012-03-18,6,Facebook without users,"I love Facebook so so do I only give it two stars? A number of reasons.1  Without Members, Facebook would not exist. Yet they treat members with contempt. Their system prompts me to add new suggested users but when I do, they stop me by saying I don't know them. In some cases, this happens despite me having 7 or 8 mutual friends with that person.2   One of my friends sent a ""friend request"" to someone she thought she knew. That person reported her and my friend was banned for a week from making any friend requests. No chance to explain or anything, just treated her with contempt.3   Worst of all, there are many business pages who use Facebook to gain new customers and then scam them. These sites use images that breach copyright and they block anybody who posts a negative comment or asks a question they don't like. While we can be blocked and scammed by these businesses, there is no way on Facebook for us to report these companies who abuse Facebook. So Facebook has become a tool for these businesses to cheat people and we have no voice. Facebook is great and I love it but they need to remember that it would be nothing without it's members.",2

It had become a genuine 'Social Network'.Clearly, fast evolution is required in any early E-Project if it's to grow and survive in such a competitive world but after a while you simply have to STOP TWATTING about with it!

5,Customer Nyree Wadman,2011-12-18,7,Keeps me in touch with family and friends worldwide. Good privacy controls.,"It's invaluable for a cattered family, especially once we've all got the Social Fixer application working to control the flood of commercial and other rubbish.  Constant changes are unwelcome but can be reversed with the Social Fixer application.  Being able to 'stream' various groups and categories of interest is valuable, as is the ability to upload photos and link to videos and music.  One thing I would NEVER do, though, is assume that it's free from hackers. I make sure NEVER to link Facebook to other internet activities and sites, and I am very vigilant about the amount of information I place there - even with full privacy controls in place, I would never, for example, be stupid enough to give my correct birthdate - identity thieves are everywhere.   I do not link my Facebook account to anything else I do online, particularly my email accounts.   I don't like being 'all joined up'.  It's not safe or courteous, to lay my email contacts open to being blattered with Facebook-generated communications.",4

CONSUMER,2011-08-03,26,"waste of time joining, it is not real life","If you are remotely anti social, single, or have no kids , pets and never go on holiday and never appear in pics, etc , then avoid joining.  Cos, you WON'T be able to pretend your kids are made of sugar, your spouse is straight out of a fairy tale and your holiday and wedding snaps beat the royals any day. Also if you are a female aged 60+ pls don't join, as you won't comprehend that EVERYONE YOU ADD (and some public members) can read EVERYTHING on your wall posts. ie ""Hi Mavis, I had my pile operation,  my ringer isn't so sore now, sitting on an ice pack, Bill can't have anal for a few weeks, hope you are well, write back soon, much love Jean xx "" it isn't exactly private! But they dont know how to bloody use it!! Random  faces that come up of friends of friends? You get bombarded with friends of friends ie folk you will never meet in a lifetime . You will be bombarded with requests from weirdos! Some will shock you with their racism and filth, and you will never be done reporting and blocking the idiots! Also, you get sent send stupid game requests and childish quizzes across to you and access all your info. I LOVE IT lol cos am  constantly prying and am astounded by everything people willingly reveal. They happily share their name age where they stay and even phone number and places of work and kids pics and not even hidden. dates of birth, times they were born, holidays they are on, great for burglars and fakers of ID!WOW,  didnt even know my next door neighbour was doing half the stuff those naughty pics tsk tsk, hope his boss doesnt find the ones with Wotsits up each nostril!

However, if something goes wrong with any of the functions on their website be warned you will be waiting a long time for the issue to be addressed. To act as a buffer to the many people having problems, Facebook has a help section. This is an area for people to post website issues and await a reply from someone who can help.

10,Dan Martin,2011-05-20,9,A revelation in social interaction; but with more holes than a cheese grater,"I am, like most teens - on facebook. I make about 10 posts every day (much to the digression of my friends) about everything ranging from my day at college, quotes, music, film - all sorts. Ive been using the service since late-2008 and have watched the many updates.The problem with Facebook is it keeps wanting to 'tamper' with itself - which is just making it worse, and terrible to use. Instead of looking at making the website run faster, produce less errors etc they seem to find it more useful to introduce futile additions such as 'the light box' (or Theatre mode for viewing picture) or changing the layout of my newsfeed etc.There are so many problems with Facebook; I question why 'we' all use it still. I understand its such a hive of activity; but so is Google - and they don't seem to have a problem (thinking of all their services Mail, Search, Checkout, Translate, Maps, Picasa, Buzz etc.) ?Im not the only one to think this. On a postive note; it has revolutionized how we all communicate with each other - and everything which used to be seen as 'private' ends up on Facebook, and  we are now communicating with each other 24 hours of a day. Being able to 'look through the keyhole' at other peoples lives..... it is an astonishing thing Facebook - its just so broken.If Facebook are reading this; then here's my message.Ok, you've sorted out the privacy (great thanks for that by the way :) ), but now can you look to sorting out the stability and performance of your website? Instead of tinkering with stupid things that no-one wants, and look crass (i.e. light-box).",3

12,sam,2011-04-27,5,Useful for photos and events... but some people need to get a life.,"When the phenomenon that is Facebook hit the world, people hastily joined, leaving many a myspace and Bebo account to gather dust. Even mum, nan and fido eventually got in on the action. Now I'm all for networking but when I log in and see the same people online all the time, it makes me laugh. Along with attention seeking statuses and constant farmville updates from friends, it can annoy you. Although statuses such as 'I might top myself tonight' or 'I wish I wasn't alone =(' are humorous, it eventually stops being funny.Overall it's good for photos, events and remembering birthdays. On the flip side - shitty online games, friend hoarding and the urge to punch some people - not so good. You only need to use once daily, twice if you're desperate. Any more and you need to get a life. As for myself, weekly will suffice.",3
